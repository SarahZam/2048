
-	Use the arrow keys (left, right, up and down) to play the game. 
	Every time the user presses the arrow keys, the console will print out the arrows pressed. 
	The number of moves made will be printed too. 
	If the move is invalid the console will print "Not a valid move" and it will not be counted as a move.
	
-	Use R to reset the game. The user will be asked in the console if they want to reset the game. Answer with Y for yes or N for no in the console. 
	If the user puts in an invalid answer, the console will let the user know it is invalid and ask to press R again.
	
-	Use Q to quit the game. The user will be asked in the console if they want to quit the game. Answer with Y for yes or N for no in the console. 
	If the user puts in an invalid answer, the console will let the user know it is invalid and ask to press Q again.
	
-	If any other key besides the arrow keys and Q and R are used, the console will print out "Not a valid move" 

-	initial board has two random numbers (2 and 4) and probability of generating 2 is 0.8 while 4 is 0.2 

-	If a move does not change the position of any of the pieces, itâ€™s not a valid move. 

-	The game is over if no number can be added and the board is full. You win the game if you get to 2048. 

- 	The game keeps tabs on the number of moves made and the maximum number on the board and prints them out on the console.  
	
- 	The game keeps score and shows it in the canvas. 

-   	I used multiple arrays, arraylists and linkedlists throughout my code.
